The talk was awesome. It&rsquo;s incredible to see what kind of things you can do with a base system as good as Kubernetes.
However, I missed one thing. The example provided by Kelsey was a Go application.

If you don&rsquo;t know about Kong yet, you should take a look. It&rsquo;s an Open Source API Gateway, they define themselves as: &ldquo;The open-source management layer for APIs, delivering high performance and reliability.&rdquo; and they are quite right.
I was playing with Kong lately at work (jobandtalent.com, we are hiring!) and I think that it could be pretty awesome as a entry layer to your microservices platform running in Kubernetes.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/kong-k8s/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/k8s_flocker_plugin/>Kubernetes volume plugins and Flocker</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>20-10-2015</span>

The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that thought about this, but I didn&rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?
Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most important disadvantage is the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; way of checking the error just after the line that can raise it.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/errors/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>26-08-2014</span>

We were planning to do some changes in our architecture but it&rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper. I was trying, trust me, but it was impossible.
When I started with this task I did it with lucidchart, after it got so messy I moved to graphviz, but even with the usual good graphs that I get from graphviz it was impossible to get something readable this time.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/neo4j_architecture/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/flats/>How to find a flat in London with some help</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>03-08-2014</span>

Summarising it a little bit, I would say that some of the cases explained there are things that you are going to finish doing even without knowing that you are doing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, but they are other examples that are incredible useful and clever & I would love to assist to this conference few months ago.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/go_meetup_mar_2014/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tailing-with-tmux/>Tailing multiple logs with tmux</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>15-03-2014</span>

The colors scheme that you use is something really personal, but it always help when somebody checked them and show them to you without the embarrasment of doing it yourself, and this is what I will do, because I was looking, but out of the amazing vimcolorschemetest project nobody seems to give importance to this.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/colors/>Read more ‚Üí</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/winter-hackathon-2012/>PyGrunn Winter Hackathon 2012</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>27-11-2012</span>
