The public speaking bit is for two reason: keep forcing myself to speak English and&mldr; to lose my fear about talking English in front of a bunch of people you don&rsquo;t know about a tech that they probably know better than you.</p><p>I could do it much better than I did, but I am happy with the results.</p><h2 id=my-english-talks>My English talks</h2><h3 id=custom-volume-plugins--kubeconhttpskubeconio>Custom Volume Plugins @ <a href=https://kubecon.io>Kubecon</a></h3><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33VzHXuuRs4">Video</a> & <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/custom-volume-plugins>slides</a></em></p><p>I prepared this talk a lot, but I was pretty nervous on stage I did a terrible job. Some people said that they learn a lot of new concepts, but they were just trying to be friendly :) Probably I underestimated the pressure behind a Kubecon talk and I will fix this in the future.</p><h3 id=python-kubernetes-and-friends--pygrunnhttpwwwpygrunnorg>Python, Kubernetes and friends @ <a href=http://www.pygrunn.org/>PyGrunn</a></h3><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tsaMVoydDg">Video</a> & <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/python-kubernetes-and-friends>Slides</a></em></p><p>I gave this in the best (IMHO, but I could be biased) Python conference in the Netherlands, it went pretty well, I knew the things I did pretty badly in my previous talk at Kubeconf and I tried to fix the problems. However, if you check the video and you can give me some advice, feel free.</p><h3 id=from-pets-to-cattle-the-way-of-kubernetes>From pets to cattle, the way of Kubernetes</h3><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_Kh4LMiiqQ">Video</a> & <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/from-pets-to-cattle-the-way-of-kubernetes>Slides</a></em></p><p>This talk was in Spain, but since it was a big conference I gave it in English for non-Spanish speakers. I think the talk was ok, I got a 4 out 5 in their feedback tool, but it seems I didn&rsquo;t attach the people because nobody asking anything at the end. Out of camera I got several questions tho.</p><h2 id=and-the-spanish-ones>And the Spanish ones</h2><p>All these talks were internal Jobandtalent talks for my ex-colleagues, I hope it helped them, they definitely helped me, it was a trusty environment and the questions were really interesting. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t ask that much in a conference but it helps the speaker (in this case me) to improve.</p><h3 id=go-101--jobandtalenthttpwwwjobandtalentcom>Go 101 @ <a href=http://www.jobandtalent.com/>Jobandtalent</a></h3><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaywpuLV4BY">Video</a> & <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/go-101-updated>Slides</a></em></p><h3 id=kubernetes-101--jobandtalenthttpwwwjobandtalentcom>Kubernetes 101 @ <a href=http://www.jobandtalent.com/>Jobandtalent</a></h3><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YmhMM_q4uI">Video</a> & <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/kubernetes-101>Slides</a></em></p><h3 id=docker-101--jobandtalenthttpwwwjobandtalentcom>Docker 101 @ <a href=http://www.jobandtalent.com/>Jobandtalent</a></h3><p><em><a href=https://speakerdeck.com/agonzalezro/docker-101>Slides</a></em></p><p>Out of that list I gave some other, for example, about <a href=https://github.com/agonzalezro/goqui/blob/master/examples/neo4j_intro_slides.neo4j>Neo4J</a> and a workshop with my friend <a href=https://twitter.com/ipedrazas>@ipedrazas</a> about Kubernetes & Docker, here, in Spain.
