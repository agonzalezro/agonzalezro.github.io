that, if you use any other way I would be happy to hear it on the comments.</p><p>I usually use <code>boot2docker</code> on my machine to run container, but it looks like
it was misbehaving a little bit when I was trying to create the binary of my
dev branch with:</p><pre><code>$ make binary
</code></pre><p>Actually, it was just not creating it.</p><p>I could also create some cross-compiled binaries but that didn&rsquo;t work either.
It was a really weird situation because I couldn&rsquo;t find the path that it was
saying that it was creating. Not in my machine, not in my boot2docker VM
either. So, after some frustrating time I decided to go with vagrant.</p><h2 id=what-i-wanted>What I wanted?</h2><ul><li>My vim! I couldn&rsquo;t live without that.</li><li>My ssh keys for github and similar without copying them to the vagrant box.</li></ul><h2 id=how-i-did-it>How I did it?</h2><h3 id=vagrant>vagrant</h3><p>It was a simple process after you have clear what you really want to do:</p><pre><code>$ cd myawesomebox
$ vagrant init  # Edit the file if you want more memory or similar
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/docker
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo su -
</code></pre><p>What we did there? We have created a <code>Vagrantfile</code> and we clone the repo in the
same folder. Thanks to that when we are inside the vagrant box (with <code>vagrant ssh</code>) we will be able to access to it on the path <code>/vagrant</code> of your box.</p><p>The advantage of this approach is that you can access to all the docker code
from your host machine in the path <code>myawesomebox</code> so you will not need to copy
any key, any conf or anything like that.</p><h3 id=docker>docker</h3><p>Now it&rsquo;s time to update your docker server and create your on docker client
(remember that we are logged in as root on that box):</p><pre><code># cd /vagrant/docker
# make build&amp;&amp;make binary
# service docker stop
# cp bundles/1.3.2-dev/binary/docker-1.3.2-dev /usr/bin/docker
# service docker start
</code></pre><p>Where <code>1.3.2</code> is the current version at the time of writing &
<code>/usr/bin/docker</code> is your old docker server binary.</p><p>Now you are running a new server, but where is the client?! Easy peasy, on the
same place that the server was originally:</p><pre><code># bundles/1.3.2-dev/binary/docker
...
</code></pre><p>I usually alias it to the letter <code>d</code> to access to it quicker without moving
stuff around:</p><pre><code># alias d=&quot;`pwd`/bundles/1.3.2-dev/binary/docker&quot;
</code></pre><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?</h2><p>I would say that develop some nice pull request? Or at least try! It&rsquo;s fun
anyway :)</p><p>I went through all this pain while <a href=http://twitter.com/eloycoto>@eloycoto</a> &
me were developing a <a href=https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/9415>small PR to show vertical <code>ps</code>
outputs</a>, so, thanks mate!</p><p>If you have any question or you think that my way of doing this stinks, please,
let me know! I would really, really appreciate it.</p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>// Álex Go{,5z}</span>
