PyGrunn!</p><p>This is a really good new for me because PyGrunn is the conference that
my old colleagues organize since years ago. I was on it first time in
2011 just one week after I started working at
<a href=http://paylogic.com>Paylogic</a>. I meet a lot of interesting people
there and I will see them again this year!</p><p>In 2012 I repeat, but at that time I had already started to organize the
&ldquo;Monthly PyGrunn"s with <a href=http://twitter.com/_ivor>Ivor</a>. TBH that talks
were quite successful, and not for the quantity of people that we get
there, if not for the quality of them and the networking after!</p><p>I am really happy too because going there I will be able to see a lot of
friends that I miss! I just moved here 5 months ago but I really want to
see them!</p><p>Now, the less important thing: about the talk! I will be talking about
Thrift and how can we use it to talk between different applications in
different languages (in the examples: Python & Scala). When PyGrunn
finish I think that I will have a video where you can see the talk (or
check my English) and I will upload the slides too!</p><p>Thanks to <a href=http://www.pygrunn.org>PyGrunn</a> for give me this chance!</p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>// Álex Go{,5z}</span>
