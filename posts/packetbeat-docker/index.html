application performance management tools in the opensource community. It&rsquo;s now
part of the <a href=https://www.elastic.co/products/beats>beats</a> that Elastic provide
us to monitor our applications. What it does is analyze our data packets to
send some useful information to ElasticSearch.</p><p>After the introduction you probably realize that we will need: ElasticSearch
installed and if you want to see something useful you will need Kibana as well.
There is a <a href=https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/current/packetbeat-getting-started.html>guide for getting
started</a>
that explains the process pretty clearly. The &ldquo;problem&rdquo; with that guide is that
you need to install everything in your machine, this blog post is a 101 to have
it quickly running into containers.</p><p>As mentioned, we will need ES and Kibana:</p><pre><code>docker run -d -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 --name elasticsearch-pb elasticsearch
docker run -d -p 5601:5601 --name kibana-pb --link elasticsearch-pb:elasticsearch \
  -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200 kibana
</code></pre><p>Now we have all the required things to run our packetbeat. There are few points
that I want to raise before doing so:</p><ol><li>packetbeat will be monitoring our network traffic, this means that our
container running packetbeat needs to have access to the host network.</li><li>the last <code>Dockerfile</code> I found regarding this was:
<a href=https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-docker>https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-docker</a> by
<a href=https://twitter.com/tudor_g>Tudor</a> (one of the original developers) but
it is a little bit old. So I made my own based on that (should PR but I
wonder why the previous was not updated yet, and it would be nice to run
something more actual than 0.5 but there are no binaries):</li></ol><p>The previous docker image will require a file <code>packetbeat.yml</code> to work after.
As a quick start you can use this one:
<a href=https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat/blob/master/packetbeat.dev.yml>https://github.com/elastic/packetbeat/blob/master/packetbeat.dev.yml</a> but
probably you would like to change your device from <code>en0</code> to <code>docker0</code>.</p><pre><code>docker build -t agonzalezro/packetbeat .
docker run --net=host agonzalezro/packetbeat
</code></pre><p>Cool, now you are ready to go! Everything that you do into your containers will
be show on Kibana, to test it go to you docker host port <code>5601</code>, it will ask
for an index pattern, change the default <code>logstash-*</code> to <code>packetbeat-*</code> and
enjoy it!</p><p><a href=/packetbeat/kibana.png><img src=/packetbeat/kibana-thumb.png alt=kibana-screenshot></a></p><p>If you have any comment, let me know here or in
<a href=http://twitter.com/agonzalezro>twitter</a>. Also, if you are interested in
monitoring with packetbeat you should definitely take a look to <a href=http://acalustra.com/how-can-i-monitor-my-voip-application.html>&ldquo;Kamailio
monitoring with statsd, SIPCapture or
Packetbeat&rdquo;</a>
by my friend <a href=http://twitter.com/eloycoto>eloycoto</a> who introduced me to
