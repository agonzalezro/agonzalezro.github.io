The income is a nice incentive, but not for the income itself if not because it would be really nice to have somebody paying for a project that you started from scratch.</p><p>In 2017 I had some ideas that after further investigation or after just chatting with some friend about them I decided to not even start or think about them again.</p><p>Why am I sharing them? Because to be fair I don&rsquo;t think I will never start them, also, maybe we can start a good brainstorm here!</p><figure class=left><img src=/lazy-cat.jpg alt="A lazy cat"><figcaption class=center>Lazy cat proudly brought to you by huffingtonpost</figcaption></figure><h2 id=tool-to-review-tweets>Tool to review Tweets</h2><p>When I was working at Jobandtalent we had several problems deciding what to tweet in the <a href=https://twitter.com/jobandtalentEng>eng account</a>. This toold could help you to decide what to publish, fix errors on the tweets, etc (as you would do with Github PRs).</p><p>In the future, it should be available as well for Instagram, Facebook, etc..</p><p>Also, it should support bots via API to add comments, for example, about the grammar of the publication.</p><p>I started this one here: <a href=http://chimpin.io/>chimpin.io</a> but the interest was near to zero.</p><h2 id=adventure-tech-book>Adventure tech book</h2><p>A tech book in the style of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure>&ldquo;Choose your own adventure&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>It would be a book that would immerse you in an adventure where you should take tech decisions: would you use git or rather copy/paste the folder adding a suffix? One of them will end up in dead, you decide.</p><h2 id=search-adventures>Search adventures</h2><p>Something like booking but for activities, ex: I want to do karting in Madrid next Saturday, show me the deals.</p><p>It would scrape the deals from different sources (not sure if it would even be legal, but I didn&rsquo;t give it that much thought).</p><h2 id=track-your-friends>Track your friends</h2><p>I am pretty bad at keeping in touch with my friends/colleagues. This tool will remember you through a simple algorithm when you need to do it! But&mldr; maybe I should fix myself and not use an app like this one üò¨</p><h2 id=status-page>Status page</h2><p>Yet another application that let you know create a status page for your site.
It should be reliable, support theming and have nice graphs about the uptimes.</p><h2 id=logstash-rescuetime>Logstash rescuetime</h2><p>I use <a href=https://www.rescuetime.com/>rescuetime</a> to track where do I spend my time with the computer. I thought that having that information in logstash would help me to create nice dashboards about my performance.</p><p>Probably I would spend more time creating the nice dashboards than doing real job.</p><h2 id=crypto-present>Crypto present</h2><p>Nice real life packaging for cryptos. Imagine you are going to a birthday and instead of giving a 20 bucks present you give them a nice package with a hash code that represent its crypto? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice? (Or not, that' the problem with crypto).</p><h2 id=starter-pack-for-wood>Starter pack for wood</h2><p>Sell packs to start working with wood. For example: a knife + a piece of wood + some instruction to create a spoon. All of it presented in a beautful package.</p><p>The problem with this is that the recurrent users after they have the tools is going to be minimal.</p><h2 id=web-for-creating-real-life-exams>Web for creating real life exams</h2><p>Teachers spend a lot of time preparing their exams, this tool would help them (collaborative) to tag exercises and the time it needs to be done. With a proper base of users they could plug&play the exams.</p><p>Imagine a Spanish teacher that want to do an exam about &ldquo;infinitive form&rdquo;, the tool could show some exercise and he/she will decide what to use and how many do they need depending on the time the exam should take.</p><p>I have some other ideas but they are fully techie so not that interesting for my purpose: ansible vendor tool, a Kubernetes bot for <a href=agonzalezro.github.com/botella>botella</a> (<a href=https://github.com/agonzalezro/agonzalezro.github.io/blob/kubernetes-for-botella/content/kubernetes/kubernetes-for-botella.md>this one is almost done</a>, but the usability isn&rsquo;t that good üòÖ), <code>pprof</code> exporter for Prometheus, ditto for Nats&mldr;</p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>// √Ålex Go{,5z}</span>
