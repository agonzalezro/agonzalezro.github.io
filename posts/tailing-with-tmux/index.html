where in the form: <code>/var/log/baselog</code>, <code>/var/log/baselog.1</code>,

aren&rsquo;t, you should!) so I&rsquo;ve decide to open all of them in different tmux
panes. Thanks to having a pane for every log what we will achieve is the
ability to scroll just one of them, maximize it in case that we need it, move
to a new window, save the buffer&mldr;</p><p>How can you achieve that? Quite simple, just download this script to some
place:</p><p>Once you have saved it installed, run it with the base log file:</p><pre><code>sh tail_several_logs.sh /var/log/baselog
</code></pre><p>The script have some limitations easily fixable:</p><ul><li>You should provide a fullpath.</li><li>The logs should be in the form of baselog.N where N is a number.</li><li>I am pretty sure that the loop can be done better.</li><li>And select the layout in every iteration is not the best of the ideas, but it
works.</li></ul><p>Feel free of do whatever you want with the script. I just hope that it&rsquo;s useful
for somebody else.</p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>// Álex Go{,5z}</span>
