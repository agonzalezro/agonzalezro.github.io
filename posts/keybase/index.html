This is not something new, it&rsquo;s part of the git protocol, but now, they will show a fancy &ldquo;verified&rdquo; label everytime you push a signed commit. Cool? Yeah, pretty cool.</p><p>One of the problems I always had since I know GPG is to keep my keys locally. I am pretty sure that some other people take care of their keys as if they were part of their family, but I didn&rsquo;t feel that need yet. <a href=https://keybase.io/>Keybase</a> partially solved this problem for me, let&rsquo;s hope it did it for you as well (ask me for an invite if you don&rsquo;t have one yet).</p><p><em>I want to start this article with a disclaimer, I am not a security professional or anything even closer to it; so, if you think I am saying anything stupid, please, do let me know. Also, if you are a heavy user of Keybase, take my steps carefully because I don&rsquo;t know if you account will continue being usable by Keybase (I would expect so, but a disclaimer is always good).</em></p><p><strong>What do we need to do then?</strong> Imagine that you are myself and you don&rsquo;t have <code>keybase</code> installed yet, also, you have a Mac:</p><pre><code>brew install keybase
</code></pre><p>Now go to your Keybase account and download the public and private key, if you don&rsquo;t know how to do it, follow <a href=http://www.keybits.net/2016/02/import-keybase-private-key/>this tutorial by Tom Atkins</a>. Summarising it:</p><ol><li>Go to your Keybase account.</li><li>Click on your key fingerprint and copy/paste that on a file.</li><li>Click on &ldquo;edit&rdquo;, then &ldquo;export my private key&rdquo; and copy/paste that as well in a different file.</li><li>Now, <code>gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import keybase-private.key</code>.</li><li>And, <code>gpg --import keybase-public.key</code>.</li></ol><p>You are good to go now.</p><p>The problem that you will face trying to use your Keybase account is that your email address will look something like <code>username@keybase.io</code> and you can not verify that account on github. For that reasonwe will need to update our key for adding your normal account email and delete the keybase one.</p><p>So, let&rsquo;s add your normal account:</p><pre><code># alex @ Alexs-MacBook-Pro in ~/Desktop [18:14:34]
