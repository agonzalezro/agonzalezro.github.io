and longitude of the flat. This way the process of plotting them is more
accurate and incredibly easy. Thanks again <a href=http://cartodb.com>CartoDB</a>!</p><p>At the end of this month I am going to move with a friend. This movement is
going to be something like the 7th one since I am living here (little bit less
than 2 years).</p><p>We are a little bit struggling trying to find a place so I decided that we need
a little bit of help:</p><p>Do you know <a href=http://gumtree.com>gumtree.com</a>? That page is extremely good for
renting if you just take care of the content (aka adverts that users upload)
but it&rsquo;s extremely bad at searching: I couldn&rsquo;t filter to know when the flat would be available and I would be able to move in! Seriously?</p><p>To fix this I made a small scraper that is going to gather data from few pages
of the search results already filtered by gumtree, check the <code>QUERY_PARAMS</code> on
the <a href=https://gist.github.com/agonzalezro/440e7bf41e77c284d735>following gist</a>:</p><p>In the other hand, the location needs to be a place close to King&rsquo;s Cross and
close to Mile End. Calculate commute times from one address to another one
doesn&rsquo;t look straightforward and easy to do, so, the best solution (in relation
dev_time/benefit) was showing all those flats in a map, and I made it thanks to
the help of CartoDB. This piece of software is amazing, basically the process
was:</p><ol><li>drag&drop the CSV to your CartoDB account.</li><li><del>click on the dropdown of the &ldquo;location&rdquo; row and then on &ldquo;Georeference&rdquo;.</del></li><li><del>in the popup that will be shown to you, you must select &ldquo;&ldquo;You have one or
more columns with the address&rdquo;, and after that you will have a georeferenced
list of points. The only bad point with this solution is that every month
you just have 100 geoferential queries available for free :(</del></li></ol><p>With that data you can create your own visualisation as I made here:</p><p>If you want to say something about this post or you want to offer me a nice
flat in London, feel free of use the comments or find me in twitter:
