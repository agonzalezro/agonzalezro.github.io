I don&amp;rsquo;t worry about formatting my code while I am writing it because I know that fmt is going to be there and it will do the work for me later.
Said that, the Go layer for Spacemacs is the one that is going to run it for you. Sometimes we need to deal with languages that don&amp;rsquo;t have this functionality, in my case, I found this issue working with Elixir &amp;amp; Ruby (happily Python forces you to write well :D).</description></item><item><title>Key bindings for Spacemacs</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/key_bindings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/key_bindings/</guid><description>I am a happy user of Spacemacs since few months ago. I was (and I still am) a vim user but Spacemacs provide you extremely good defaults and the installation of layers isn&amp;rsquo;t painful at all, things that I sadly can&amp;rsquo;t say about vim.
I ended up with a lot of configuration on my dot files and everytime I wanted to try, for example, a new language, it was difficult to get it working well.</description></item></channel></rss>
