I can just say that it was awesome, the quality of the projects, the prizes, the food, the freebies (yes, they gave us an Intel Edison)&amp;hellip;
But this post is not about that, I want to explain my project and how I made Golang work in an Intel Edison thanks to gobot.
As you are already aware, Go easily supports cross compiling creating a binary that you can use in your other devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
