You are more than 8h per day in front of your vim with some beautiful, or crappy, code in front of you. In the first case the colors doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, but in the second it&amp;rsquo;s really important to enjoy, at least, the colors!
The colors scheme that you use is something really personal, but it always help when somebody checked them and show them to you without the embarrasment of doing it yourself, and this is what I will do, because I was looking, but out of the amazing vimcolorschemetest project nobody seems to give importance to this.</description></item></channel></rss>
