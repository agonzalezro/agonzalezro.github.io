Those logs where in the form: /var/log/baselog, /var/log/baselog.1, /var/log/baselog.2 and so on. I wanted to tail them but they were being updated simultaneously so the output of the tail was being a mess.
I am a tmux user since few months ago (if you aren&amp;rsquo;t, you should!) so I&amp;rsquo;ve decide to open all of them in different tmux panes.</description></item></channel></rss>
