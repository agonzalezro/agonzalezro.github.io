I don&amp;rsquo;t worry about formatting my code while I am writing it because I know that fmt is going to be there and it will do the work for me later.
Said that, the Go layer for Spacemacs is the one that is going to run it for you. Sometimes we need to deal with languages that don&amp;rsquo;t have this functionality, in my case, I found this issue working with Elixir &amp;amp; Ruby (happily Python forces you to write well :D).</description></item></channel></rss>
