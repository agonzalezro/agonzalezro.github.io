This is not something new, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the git protocol, but now, they will show a fancy &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; label everytime you push a signed commit. Cool? Yeah, pretty cool.
One of the problems I always had since I know GPG is to keep my keys locally. I am pretty sure that some other people take care of their keys as if they were part of their family, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that need yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
