We are almost at the end of January but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end the first month of the year without doing a small recap of the talks I gave last year.
When I moved to Spain at the end of 2015 I said to myself that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to forget the little English I knew so I needed to force myself to keep traveling outside of Spain and to do some public speaking.</description></item><item><title>Graph your meetup.com group with Neo4J and some Go</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/</guid><description>Last days I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending sometime in a small project for fun. Sadly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything for production so I hacked gotagmee which is a tiny thingy that will created some goroutines to get all the members in a meetup.com group with their interests and store them in a Neo4J DB as Member or Topic entities with their respective relations.
I wrote this because I wanted to get the data, but then I realised that this piece of code is pretty neat (check the github repo for the original):</description></item><item><title>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</guid><description>As some of you already know I work at Green Man Gaming (mainly at the playfire project). We were planning to do some changes in our architecture but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper. I was trying, trust me, but it was impossible.
When I started with this task I did it with lucidchart, after it got so messy I moved to graphviz, but even with the usual good graphs that I get from graphviz it was impossible to get something readable this time.</description></item></channel></rss>
