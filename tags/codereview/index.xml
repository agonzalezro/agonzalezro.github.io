I would like to start with a disclaimer:
I am not (and I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be) a craftmanship trooper (they like to be called like that isn&amp;rsquo;t?), senior engineer with more years of experience that the technology has, guru, blablabla&amp;hellip;
I just want to show my opinion about this process (which I really like!). But more important that share my opinion, is to know what is yours, so, please, comment!</description></item></channel></rss>
