If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Kong yet, you should take a look. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source API Gateway, they define themselves as: &amp;ldquo;The open-source management layer for APIs, delivering high performance and reliability.&amp;rdquo; and they are quite right.
I was playing with Kong lately at work (jobandtalent.com, we are hiring!) and I think that it could be pretty awesome as a entry layer to your microservices platform running in Kubernetes.</description></item></channel></rss>
