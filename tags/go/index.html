However, few month back I saw a video by @francesc and his nice use case and I wrote down a new item in my mental TODO list about things I wanted to use.
Last week I had the chance to do it; we have a service that requires reading a request body to check for a Status field and also it requires to store the raw request.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/tee_reader/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/2016/>Closing 2016, a list of talks I gave</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>29-01-2017</span>

The slides are mainly examples with a little bit of history around the Go world. If you find them useful, feel free to grab them here: https://github.com/agonzalezro/slides/tree/master/go

I can just say that it was awesome, the quality of the projects, the prizes, the food, the freebies (yes, they gave us an Intel Edison)&mldr;
But this post is not about that, I want to explain my project and how I made Golang work in an Intel Edison thanks to gobot.
As you are already aware, Go easily supports cross compiling creating a binary that you can use in your other devices.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/edison_hackathon/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/golanguk2015/>The well deserved Golang UK conference is here</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>29-03-2015</span>

He had opened the blind bird at the beginning of the week and we are already close to finish those cheap tickets, so hurry up and buy a ticket. We can see for the call for papers already received that the quality of the talks is going to be awesome, but don&rsquo;t miss your opportunity as send us a paper before May 31st.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/golanguk2015/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/>Graph your meetup.com group with Neo4J and some Go</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>25-02-2015</span>

Sadly I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for production so I hacked gotagmee which is a tiny thingy that will created some goroutines to get all the members in a meetup.com group with their interests and store them in a Neo4J DB as Member or Topic entities with their respective relations.
I wrote this because I wanted to get the data, but then I realised that this piece of code is pretty neat (check the github repo for the original):</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/gotagmee/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/errors/>How to manage multiple errors in Go</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>17-10-2014</span>

The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that thought about this, but I didn&rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?
Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most important disadvantage is the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; way of checking the error just after the line that can raise it.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/errors/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/go_meetup_mar_2014/>12 Go Best Practices</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>02-04-2014</span>

Summarising it a little bit, I would say that some of the cases explained there are things that you are going to finish doing even without knowing that you are doing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, but they are other examples that are incredible useful and clever & I would love to assist to this conference few months ago.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/go_meetup_mar_2014/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg></span><span class=logo__text>// Álex Go{,5z}</span>
