We are almost at the end of January but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end the first month of the year without doing a small recap of the talks I gave last year.
When I moved to Spain at the end of 2015 I said to myself that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to forget the little English I knew so I needed to force myself to keep traveling outside of Spain and to do some public speaking.</description></item><item><title>Log your Docker containers from a container with packetbeat</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/packetbeat-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/packetbeat-docker/</guid><description>packetbeat is one of the best application performance management tools in the opensource community. It&amp;rsquo;s now part of the beats that Elastic provide us to monitor our applications. What it does is analyze our data packets to send some useful information to ElasticSearch.
After the introduction you probably realize that we will need: ElasticSearch installed and if you want to see something useful you will need Kibana as well. There is a guide for getting started that explains the process pretty clearly.</description></item><item><title>Docker workshop at Shopa</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker_shopa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker_shopa/</guid><description>Today I gave a workshop at Shopa about Docker: what is it, why it&amp;rsquo;s useful for us and why it can even be more useful.
I understand that just the slides without any context can be a little bit misleading, but in case that it helps somebody I will share them here:
The design of the PDF looks uglier than it really is, so if you want the html slides you can always use the Dockerfile provided with the source of the slides :)</description></item><item><title>How I prepared my Mac to make some Docker development</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker-env/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker-env/</guid><description>This post is about how I did it! not about a standard way or something like that, if you use any other way I would be happy to hear it on the comments.
I usually use boot2docker on my machine to run container, but it looks like it was misbehaving a little bit when I was trying to create the binary of my dev branch with:
$ make binary Actually, it was just not creating it.</description></item><item><title>Dockerizing Pligg with Fig</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/pligg-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/pligg-docker/</guid><description>For a pet project I needed Pligg which is kinda a social network site in the style of the old-digg (with karma and this kind of things).
Installing a LAMP system is kinda boring stuff, so, for that and for the sake of learning I decided to go with Docker &amp;amp; Fig. Sadly or luckily, every time that I dockerize something I find a lot of unexpected problems that slow me down, but&amp;hellip; you always learn something!</description></item></channel></rss>
