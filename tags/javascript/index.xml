We were using it for a really fancy application inside our backoffice, it was quite funny write it and Oleg decided to share the knowledge.
I used the techtalk to take some notes and, since this piece of code will have no sense out of our backoffice, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a small example that you can find as a gist on my github.</description></item></channel></rss>
