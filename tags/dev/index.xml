If you know me you probably know that I am always complaining that I want to start some pet project that could give me some kind of income. The income is a nice incentive, but not for the income itself if not because it would be really nice to have somebody paying for a project that you started from scratch.
In 2017 I had some ideas that after further investigation or after just chatting with some friend about them I decided to not even start or think about them again.</description></item><item><title>How to read a Reader twice</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tee_reader/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tee_reader/</guid><description>
Some time ago I read about TeeReader but to be fair, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give it that much thought. However, few month back I saw a video by @francesc and his nice use case and I wrote down a new item in my mental TODO list about things I wanted to use.
Last week I had the chance to do it; we have a service that requires reading a request body to check for a Status field and also it requires to store the raw request.</description></item><item><title>IoT hackathon with Intel Edison and Go</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/edison_hackathon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/edison_hackathon/</guid><description>
I spent last weekend in a hackathon organised by Intel to show their Intel Edison platform. I can just say that it was awesome, the quality of the projects, the prizes, the food, the freebies (yes, they gave us an Intel Edison)&amp;hellip;
But this post is not about that, I want to explain my project and how I made Golang work in an Intel Edison thanks to gobot.
As you are already aware, Go easily supports cross compiling creating a binary that you can use in your other devices.</description></item><item><title>Graph your meetup.com group with Neo4J and some Go</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/</guid><description>
Last days I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending sometime in a small project for fun. Sadly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything for production so I hacked gotagmee which is a tiny thingy that will created some goroutines to get all the members in a meetup.com group with their interests and store them in a Neo4J DB as Member or Topic entities with their respective relations.
I wrote this because I wanted to get the data, but then I realised that this piece of code is pretty neat (check the github repo for the original):</description></item><item><title>How I prepared my Mac to make some Docker development</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker-env/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker-env/</guid><description>
This post is about how I did it! not about a standard way or something like that, if you use any other way I would be happy to hear it on the comments.
I usually use boot2docker on my machine to run container, but it looks like it was misbehaving a little bit when I was trying to create the binary of my dev branch with:
$ make binary Actually, it was just not creating it.</description></item><item><title>How to manage multiple errors in Go</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/errors/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/errors/</guid><description>
Let me start with a disclaimer, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if this is a pattern that must be followed or it&amp;rsquo;s just a weird idea coming out of my head.
The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that thought about this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?
Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most important disadvantage is the &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; way of checking the error just after the line that can raise it.</description></item><item><title>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</guid><description>
As some of you already know I work at Green Man Gaming (mainly at the playfire project). We were planning to do some changes in our architecture but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper. I was trying, trust me, but it was impossible.
When I started with this task I did it with lucidchart, after it got so messy I moved to graphviz, but even with the usual good graphs that I get from graphviz it was impossible to get something readable this time.</description></item><item><title>How to find a flat in London with some help</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/flats/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/flats/</guid><description>
EDIT: I&amp;rsquo;ve added a little bit more of code to the gist to get the latitude and longitude of the flat. This way the process of plotting them is more accurate and incredibly easy. Thanks again CartoDB!
At the end of this month I am going to move with a friend. This movement is going to be something like the 7th one since I am living here (little bit less than 2 years).</description></item><item><title>codereview from the POV of a noob</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/codereview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/codereview/</guid><description>
Hi g(irl|uy)s! I would like to start with a disclaimer:
I am not (and I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be) a craftmanship trooper (they like to be called like that isn&amp;rsquo;t?), senior engineer with more years of experience that the technology has, guru, blablabla&amp;hellip;
I just want to show my opinion about this process (which I really like!). But more important that share my opinion, is to know what is yours, so, please, comment!</description></item><item><title>backbone.js + underscore: small intro</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/backbone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/backbone/</guid><description>
Today, Oleg gave a talk about backbone at Paylogic. We were using it for a really fancy application inside our backoffice, it was quite funny write it and Oleg decided to share the knowledge.
I used the techtalk to take some notes and, since this piece of code will have no sense out of our backoffice, I&amp;rsquo;ve written a small example that you can find as a gist on my github.</description></item></channel></rss>
