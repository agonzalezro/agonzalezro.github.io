As you are already aware, Go easily supports cross compiling creating a binary that you can use in your other devices.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/edison_hackathon/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/gotagmee/>Graph your meetup.com group with Neo4J and some Go</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>25-02-2015</span>

Sadly I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for production so I hacked gotagmee which is a tiny thingy that will created some goroutines to get all the members in a meetup.com group with their interests and store them in a Neo4J DB as Member or Topic entities with their respective relations.
I wrote this because I wanted to get the data, but then I realised that this piece of code is pretty neat (check the github repo for the original):</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/gotagmee/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/docker-env/>How I prepared my Mac to make some Docker development</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>01-12-2014</span>

I usually use boot2docker on my machine to run container, but it looks like it was misbehaving a little bit when I was trying to create the binary of my dev branch with:

The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that thought about this, but I didn&rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?
Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most important disadvantage is the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; way of checking the error just after the line that can raise it.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/errors/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>26-08-2014</span>

We were planning to do some changes in our architecture but it&rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper.

When I started with this task I did it with lucidchart, after it got so messy I moved to graphviz, but even with the usual good graphs that I get from graphviz it was impossible to get something readable this time.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/neo4j_architecture/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/flats/>How to find a flat in London with some help</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>03-08-2014</span>
