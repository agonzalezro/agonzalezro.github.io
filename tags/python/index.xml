We are almost at the end of January but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end the first month of the year without doing a small recap of the talks I gave last year.
When I moved to Spain at the end of 2015 I said to myself that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to forget the little English I knew so I needed to force myself to keep traveling outside of Spain and to do some public speaking.</description></item><item><title>How to deploy and update a python app using Kubernetes</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/oct_2015_djugl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/oct_2015_djugl/</guid><description>Two days ago I gave a small talk in the DJUGL (Django User Group London) explaining how we could deploy a test application into Kubernetes. This post is going to explain something pretty similar, how to deploy a Flask app into Kubernetes and how to rolling update it.
Before starting, you can find all the materials of this post in my k8s-py-example repo.
Download the app and build it twice, one for each of the version that you want to deploy.</description></item><item><title>Python and Scala smoke the peace pipe</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/pygrunn_2013/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/pygrunn_2013/</guid><description>This was my talk on the PyGrunn conference last Friday.
I was explaining how can you communicate services written in different languages using Apache Thrift for that.
In few days the videos will be available, but TBH, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if I will publish it here. It was not the first time that I talk in public using English, but it will be the first time that it is recorded&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t really know if I want to see that!</description></item><item><title>codereview from the POV of a noob</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/codereview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/codereview/</guid><description>Hi g(irl|uy)s! I would like to start with a disclaimer:
I am not (and I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be) a craftmanship trooper (they like to be called like that isn&amp;rsquo;t?), senior engineer with more years of experience that the technology has, guru, blablabla&amp;hellip;
I just want to show my opinion about this process (which I really like!). But more important that share my opinion, is to know what is yours, so, please, comment!</description></item></channel></rss>
