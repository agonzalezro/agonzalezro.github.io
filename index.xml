I am pretty sure that in my case the imposter syndrome has helped me to develop my abilities, especially in tech which is my &amp;ldquo;area of knowledge&amp;rdquo;.
Life is split into stages, some of those stages are better for your growth than others. There are times when you think you are the king of the world and that you already know everything you need to know but if you are lucky enough to pass through that phase you will realize that you didn&amp;rsquo;t have all the answers.</description></item><item><title>How to prepare the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/cka/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/cka/</guid><description>Finally last weekend I did the CKA exam, I was procrastinating it a bit in part because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect since Kubernetes is huge and I thought that each day extra I spend reading about it would help me.
TLDR; I did pass the exam and if you work daily with Kubernetes or variants as Openshift you will be ok, they are not trying to catch you in some weird question that not even Kelsey would know how to answer üòÄ</description></item><item><title>Projects I didn't do in 2017</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/projects_2017/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/projects_2017/</guid><description>If you know me you probably know that I am always complaining that I want to start some pet project that could give me some kind of income. The income is a nice incentive, but not for the income itself if not because it would be really nice to have somebody paying for a project that you started from scratch.
In 2017 I had some ideas that after further investigation or after just chatting with some friend about them I decided to not even start or think about them again.</description></item><item><title>How to read a Reader twice</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tee_reader/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tee_reader/</guid><description>Some time ago I read about TeeReader but to be fair, I didn&amp;rsquo;t give it that much thought. However, few month back I saw a video by @francesc and his nice use case and I wrote down a new item in my mental TODO list about things I wanted to use.

We are almost at the end of January but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to end the first month of the year without doing a small recap of the talks I gave last year.
When I moved to Spain at the end of 2015 I said to myself that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to forget the little English I knew so I needed to force myself to keep traveling outside of Spain and to do some public speaking.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Your Kubernetes Pods With Elixir</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/elixir-scheduler/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/elixir-scheduler/</guid><description>This was originally posted on deis.com.
Kelsey Hightower gave a really interesting talk at ContainerSched about how to create your own scheduler using the Kubernetes HTTP API.
The talk was awesome. It&amp;rsquo;s incredible to see what kind of things you can do with a base system as good as Kubernetes.
However, I missed one thing. The example provided by Kelsey was a Go application. Which is the main language used with Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Save hook for major modes</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/save-hook/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/save-hook/</guid><description>One of the things I like the most about Go is its go fmt tool. I don&amp;rsquo;t worry about formatting my code while I am writing it because I know that fmt is going to be there and it will do the work for me later.
Said that, the Go layer for Spacemacs is the one that is going to run it for you. Sometimes we need to deal with languages that don&amp;rsquo;t have this functionality, in my case, I found this issue working with Elixir &amp;amp; Ruby (happily Python forces you to write well :D).</description></item><item><title>Key bindings for Spacemacs</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/key_bindings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/key_bindings/</guid><description>I am a happy user of Spacemacs since few months ago. I was (and I still am) a vim user but Spacemacs provide you extremely good defaults and the installation of layers isn&amp;rsquo;t painful at all, things that I sadly can&amp;rsquo;t say about vim.
I ended up with a lot of configuration on my dot files and everytime I wanted to try, for example, a new language, it was difficult to get it working well.</description></item><item><title>Signing your GitHub work with your Keybase keys</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/keybase/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/keybase/</guid><description>As you may know, yesterday, GitHub has presented a way to verify your commits on their platform. This is not something new, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the git protocol, but now, they will show a fancy &amp;ldquo;verified&amp;rdquo; label everytime you push a signed commit. Cool? Yeah, pretty cool.
One of the problems I always had since I know GPG is to keep my keys locally. I am pretty sure that some other people take care of their keys as if they were part of their family, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel that need yet.</description></item><item><title>Using Kong with Kubernetes</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/kong-k8s/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/kong-k8s/</guid><description>This was originally posted on k8s.uk.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Kong yet, you should take a look. It&amp;rsquo;s an Open Source API Gateway, they define themselves as: &amp;ldquo;The open-source management layer for APIs, delivering high performance and reliability.&amp;rdquo; and they are quite right.
I was playing with Kong lately at work (jobandtalent.com, we are hiring!) and I think that it could be pretty awesome as a entry layer to your microservices platform running in Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes volume plugins and Flocker</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/k8s_flocker_plugin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/k8s_flocker_plugin/</guid><description>Last month I was working with the guys from Jetstack &amp;amp; ClusterHQ developing a plugina for Kubernetes that will allow the people to easily use Flocker there.
Yesterday I had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Rimas Mocevicius, Kelsey Hightower &amp;amp; Ivan Pedrazas at the Kubernetes London meetup to present the plugin and show the audience that creating volume plugins for Kubernetes is easier than it looks at the first glance.</description></item><item><title>How to deploy and update a python app using Kubernetes</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/oct_2015_djugl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/oct_2015_djugl/</guid><description>Two days ago I gave a small talk in the DJUGL (Django User Group London) explaining how we could deploy a test application into Kubernetes. This post is going to explain something pretty similar, how to deploy a Flask app into Kubernetes and how to rolling update it.
Before starting, you can find all the materials of this post in my k8s-py-example repo.
Download the app and build it twice, one for each of the version that you want to deploy.</description></item><item><title>Log your Docker containers from a container with packetbeat</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/packetbeat-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/packetbeat-docker/</guid><description>packetbeat is one of the best application performance management tools in the opensource community. It&amp;rsquo;s now part of the beats that Elastic provide us to monitor our applications. What it does is analyze our data packets to send some useful information to ElasticSearch.
After the introduction you probably realize that we will need: ElasticSearch installed and if you want to see something useful you will need Kibana as well. There is a guide for getting started that explains the process pretty clearly.</description></item><item><title>Go introduction at Shopa</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/go101/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/go101/</guid><description>Here at Shopa we use Go for some services but we use a lot of Rails as well so not everybody needs to know Go. This is why I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do a small introduction to it in one of our workshops.
The slides are mainly examples with a little bit of history around the Go world. If you find them useful, feel free to grab them here: https://github.com/agonzalezro/slides/tree/master/go

I understand that just the slides without any context can be a little bit misleading, but in case that it helps somebody I will share them here:

The second disclaimer is that I am pretty sure that I am not the only mind that thought about this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see it in use in any place. Why?
Error handling in Go has his advantages and disadvantages, for me, the most important disadvantage is the &amp;ldquo;weird&amp;rdquo; way of checking the error just after the line that can raise it.</description></item><item><title>Draw (and more) your architecture with Neo4J</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/neo4j_architecture/</guid><description>As some of you already know I work at Green Man Gaming (mainly at the playfire project). We were planning to do some changes in our architecture but it&amp;rsquo;s extremely hard to have an idea of all our services and DBs in just a piece of A4 paper.

His talk was about best practices (and advices) when you are programming in Go.
Summarising it a little bit, I would say that some of the cases explained there are things that you are going to finish doing even without knowing that you are doing &amp;ldquo;best practices&amp;rdquo;, but they are other examples that are incredible useful and clever &amp;amp; I would love to assist to this conference few months ago.</description></item><item><title>Tailing multiple logs with tmux</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tailing-with-tmux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/tailing-with-tmux/</guid><description>I had a system that was creating a different log for each worker.

In the first case the colors doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, but in the second it&amp;rsquo;s really important to enjoy, at least, the colors!
The colors scheme that you use is something really personal, but it always help when somebody checked them and show them to you without the embarrasment of doing it yourself, and this is what I will do, because I was looking, but out of the amazing vimcolorschemetest project nobody seems to give importance to this.</description></item><item><title>PyGrunn Winter Hackathon 2012</title><link>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/winter-hackathon-2012/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://agonzalezro.github.io/posts/winter-hackathon-2012/</guid><description>Few days ago, actually, more than one week ago (but I was very busy :) we made our first PyGrunn hackathon.
